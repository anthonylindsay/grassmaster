GrassMaster is an application for farmers to help manage grass cover on their
farms. Maintaining a constant supply of high-quality green leafy grass can be
easily achieved by walking through paddocks on weekly basis and measuring the
amount of grass on the farm. Poor grazing management leads to fluctuation in
pre-grazing yields, with problems of not enough or too much grass on the farm
and can result in sub-optimal performance of the herd.

This application allows you to keep track of grass cover for your farm and plan
livestock movements accordingly.

- Create your fields. All you have to fill in is the area. You can edit existing fields or delete them.
- Tour your farm and measure the cover for your fields. Input the cover once measured for each field.
- Show the graphs to see the grass wedge. Try turning your phone on its side for a wider view.
- Run the reports to get instant calculations, e.g. AFC, total area, total cover, etc.

Added features:

- Optional field names.
- Save and archive your entire farm's data for later.
- Colour coded graph wedge for faster interpretation.
- New, improved user-interface for easier use.
